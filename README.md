# üè† Real Estate RAG App

A Gen AI-powered tool that helps Real Estate Research Analysts automate the process of extracting insights from real estate news articles using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

## Problem Statement

Real estate analysts often need to stay updated with the latest market trends by reading articles from trusted news websites such as *The Times of India*, *The Hindu*, and *Deccan Herald*. However, the current process is manual and inefficient:

- Analysts have to visit each website individually
- Read through lengthy articles
- Manually extract relevant insights
- Create summaries and reports for investment decisions

This repetitive and time-consuming task reduces productivity and delays actionable insights.

## Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

- ChatGPT lacks memory of past articles  
- Context window limitations prevent full article ingestion
- Manual copy-pasting of article content is tedious  

This tool solves all those issues by letting you *ask questions directly about multiple articles*, without switching tabs or manually summarizing content.
